### ðŸš€ Project Overview
â€¢ This project is a dynamic FAQ UI where users can toggle the visibility of answers.

â€¢ Built using React (Functional Components) with Redux for global state management.

â€¢ Uses Redux store to track which questions are expanded.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

### ðŸ“œ How It Works
1. **Redux Store (`store/index.js`)**

   â€¢ Manages the state of expanded questions.

   â€¢ Uses a reducer to handle the `TOGGLE_STATE` action.

   â€¢ Updates the `selectedQuestions` array in the Redux store.

3. **FAQ Component (`Question.jsx`)**

   â€¢ Uses `useSelector` to fetch the state from Redux.

   â€¢ Uses `useDispatch` to toggle question visibility.

   â€¢ Renders UI based on the state from Redux.

5. **Provider Setup (`main.jsx`)**

   â€¢ Wraps the app with the Redux `Provider` to enable global state access.
